# 100 IoT Projects in One Year

## About the Challenge

I decided to build **100 IoT & Embedded projects in one year (365 days)**. (Inspired by [@kritishmohapatra](https://github.com/kritishmohapatra))

This journey started on **January 31, 2026**, and the deadline is **January 31, 2027**.

The goal of this challenge is simple:

- Become better at IoT and embedded systems through consistent, hands-on practice.

Instead of focusing only on theory, I learn by building real, practical projects.

## 🎯 Goals

- Improve my IoT development skills
- Strengthen embedded programming knowledge
- Practice hardware + software integration
- Learn new tools, protocols, and devices
- Build consistency and engineering discipline

## 📈 Project Rules

To keep the challenge meaningful:

- Each project must be practical and working
- Every next project should be slightly more complex
- Explore different sensors, communication protocols, and platforms
- Focus on real-world use cases

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (varies per project)

Projects may include:

- ESP32 / STM32 / Arduino / other microcontrollers
- Sensors & actuators
- MQTT / HTTP / BLE / Wi-Fi
- Embedded C / C++
- Home automation & edge computing

## 📅 Progress

Projects will be added continuously throughout the year.

### Each project will include:

- source code
- wiring diagrams

For more complicated projects also:

- documentation
- lessons learned

## 💡 Why?

Because the best way to learn engineering is to:

**build → test → fail → improve → repeat**
